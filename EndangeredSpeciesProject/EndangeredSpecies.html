			<h2>What Exactly is a Ribbon Seal?</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ribbon seals are a type of seal that can be very easy to spot due to
			their striking, "ribbon-like" markings. Each ribbon seal is patterned with
			four white ribbons. One of them wraps around the neck, others wrap around each of the front
			flippers, and one wraps around the seal just before the back flipper. Even though
			all ribbon seals have similar markings, making them easy to distinguish, the females
			males have different coloring. The female ribbon seals are dark brown with white
			ribbons, while the male ribbon seals are black with white ribbons. Ribbon seals are quite
			large, typically weighing in around 175 pounds and are on average, 5 feet in length.
			Clearly ribbon seals are a unique and adorable animal, but they are sadly endangered.</p>

			<h2>Where Can You Find Them?</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ribbon seal is one of nine species of ice seals inhabiting the Arctic
			and is the only species in the genus Histriophoca. They inhabit the North Pacific Ocean.
			They can be found off the southern coast of Russia and to the north of Korea and Japan.
			Similar to other seals, ribbon seals are found along coasts or in the water in areas with
			cold climates.</p>
			
			<h2>Conservation</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ribbon seals are a part of the endangered species list. The most recent estimate
			that was done for the Bering Sea population of ribbon seals was about
			100,000 - 110,000 seals. Ribbon seals are endangered mainly due to changes in the climate
			that could melt icebergs, making less space for the ribbon seals to live. Ribbon
			seals can also affected be commercial fishing in places like the Bering Sea. Oil and
			gas extraction can cause spills and intense pollution, further cutting down the already
			low ribbon seal population.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly ribbon seals have a lot of things forcing them onto
			the endangered species list, but there is a way for everyone to help. Since the main issues all
			are based around the central topic of water pollution and general air pollution, it is
			important that all people are mindful of the ways they contribute to pollution. We must do the simple things
			to prevent pollution like using less energy by turning off lights in rooms when you are not in them, avoiding
			idling your car for long periods of time, and choosing environmentally friendly cleaners/products. For
			more information on ways to prevent pollution, visit <a href="https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/air/tsb/ams/aqmdp/share.htm">NHDES</a>.</p>
