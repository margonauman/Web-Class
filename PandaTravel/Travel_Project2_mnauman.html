		<h2>Introduction to Uxmal</h2>
			<p>Uxmal, Mexico is an ancient Mayan city that many people visit to see its wonderful architecture.
			Uxmal is has extremely large structures that account for most of the area in the city. The Pyramid of the Magician
			and box-shaped structure with a field in the middle, the Governor's Palace are the structures that make Uxmal such a beautiful city.</p>
			<!--this paragraph is the description of the topic shown in the h2 heading above-->
			
		<h2>Pyramid of the Magician</h2>
			<p>The Pyramid of the Magician is a huge pyramid, built in the Puuc style, which was a Mayan building style.
			It stands about 260 feet tall from the bottom of the base and consists of five levels. The five levels of this
			pyramid represent five different temples. Temple I, the first level, is decorated mainly with masks of the Mayan
			rain god, Chaac. Temple II has a central chamber supported by columns and can be entered through an opening in the
			upper part of the eastern staircase. Temple III is built onto the back of Temple II, therefor it is not visible
			from the outside and can only be accessed through Temple II. It consists of a small central shrine and an antechamber.
			Temple IV is the most richly decorated out of all of the temples. Temple V, also known as The House of the Magician
			or Soothsayer, is the final building phase of the pyramid. This structure sits atop the pyramid and is composed
			of three rooms and also exhibits lattice ornamentation. This temple is considered very unique because of its rounded
			sides, considerable height, steep slope, and unusual elliptical base.</p>

		<p>The Governor's Palace is a very large and beautiful structure. It covers an area of 12,917 sq ft and it can be accessed by
		a stairway with three landings, with the middle landing rising to a whopping 65 feet! Clearly, this huge structure is a great place to visit
		not only to see the massive structures, but to experience the Mayan culture through the structure's architecture. It is one of
		the few Mayan cities where the casual visitor can get a good idea of how the entire ceremonial center looked in ancient times.
		It was built with well-cut stones set in a core of concrete, and the Mayans engraved these stones with their signature
		hieroglyphs and other designs. Visiting this structure will help you to better understand the culture of the Mayans and their way of life.</p>
