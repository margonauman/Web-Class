			<h1><b><i>About</i></b></h1>
				<p>It can be intimidating for women to learn and as questions when they
				are in an extreme minority. While open and welcoming, today's budding developer
				community is up to <b>91% male</b>. If we can empower more females with the
				confidence in their technological capabilities we can <b><i>begin to change this
				landscape.</i></b></p>
